CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.4
------------------------


    o An extra numerical approximation step is implemented 
    in EBMultiTest() function to avoid
    underflow. The underflow is likely due to large number of samples.
    A bug in EBMultiTest() is fixed. The bug will cause error when there is
    exactly 1 gene/isoform that needs numerical approximation.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.3
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed a bug that may generate NA FC estimates when there are no replicates.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.5.2
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o An extra numerical approximation step is 
    implemented in EBTest() function to avoid
    underflow. The underflow is likely due to large number of samples.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.3
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o In EBSeq 1.3.3, the default setting of EBTest function will remove 
    low expressed genes (genes whose 75th quantile of normalized counts is less 
    than 10) before identifying DE genes. 
    These two thresholds can be changed in EBTest function.
    We found that low expressed genes are more easily to be affected by noises. 
    Removing these genes prior to downstream analyses can improve the 
    model fitting and reduce impacts of noisy genes (e.g. genes with outliers).
